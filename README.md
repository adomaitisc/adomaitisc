# Hello There


My name is Cau√£ Adomaitis.

I am from Brazil but I am currently studying Computer Science in Boston,
at Wentworth Institute of Technology.

I have been developing for 3-4 years and now I am starting my web dev portfolio,
with some really nice creations.

I am always working on a project, but hit me up if you are interested in a collab
or a custom project. Still unemployed, lol.

### Current tech stack:
 - Typescript
 - ReactJS / NextJS
 - TailwindCSS
 - Prisma & tRPC
