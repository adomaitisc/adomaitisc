### Hey, I am Cauã,


I am from São Paulo, Brazil, studying Computer Science in Boston,
at Wentworth Institute of Technology. Currently I am starting my sophomore year
and decided that it is time for a Internship/Junior Role in a company.

Although not having any previous work experience, I have been developing simple
apps in Python, JavaScript, and Java for 3-4 years.

I have so many projects I would like to develop and the first one in line is a big
full-stack project, using JavaScript with React JS, Express, and MongoDB.

- ⚙️ Developing comfortably in Java, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS.
- 🔭 Currently researching before start a full-stack project.
