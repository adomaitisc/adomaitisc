### Hey, I am Cauã,


I am from São Paulo, Brazil, but I am studying Computer Science in Boston,
at Wentworth Intitute of Technology. Currently, I am starting my sophomore year
and decided that it is time for a Internship/Junior Role in a company.

Although not having any previous work experience, I have been developing simple
apps in Python, JavaScript, and Java for 3-4 years. The work experience said
wouldn't be self-employment, which I have done by being the single owner of a
secondary market sneaker store, doing sales, marketing, advertisement, and more.

I have so many projects I would like to develop and the first one in line is a big
full-stack project, using JavaScript withReact JS or Electron.

- ⚙️ Developing comfortably in JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS.
- 🔭 Currently working on a fullstack project and with plans for a personal website.
- 📫 How to reach me: adomaitisc@wit.edu.
